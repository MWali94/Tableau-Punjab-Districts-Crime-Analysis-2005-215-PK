# **Introduction**    

This project delves into Pakistan Punjab, distirts crime data from 2002 to 2015, providing a detailed analysis of crime trends and types with respect to population increase in different districts in Punjab Pakistan. Using pandas library and Tableau, we present the findings in an easily understandable format. This is especially beneficial for Punjab residents interested in gaining insights into crime trends in their area.

# **Methods and Tools**

Data Source: Punjab Crime Statistics Dataset, available <a href="https://opendata.com.pk/dataset/crimes-committed-in-punjab-2002-2015/resource/3c430502-b94d-4f5d-a917-a0e778f71998">here</a> , serves as the foundation of this analysis, comprising approximately 6885 rows Ã— 8 columns of data. After preprocessing the data used for this analysis is 6426 rows x 6 columns. I have attached jupyter notebook file for better understaning on how the data was processed before analysis.

Tools: Python, jupyter notebook, pandas library and the visual representation was achieved with Tableau dashboards.
